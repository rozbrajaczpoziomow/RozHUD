# RozUtils

![very high-quality logo](src/main/resources/assets/rozutils/textures/logo.png)

RozUtils contains a HUD that can display various data about the server status, dimension data, etc. as well as a command for more exact tinkering.  
As of 0.3.0+, it also re-implements the gamemode switcher from 1.16+. (this doesn't need RU to be installed server-side to work)  

**Needs to be installed both on the client and server for the HUD and command to work**

RozUtils is written in Kotlin, and as such requires Forgelin Continuous to be present.
